Mario made his first appearance as the protagonist of the arcade game Donkey Kong, released in 1981 (which used the names \"Jumpman\" and \"little Mario\" in associated paratext). Since Super Mario Bros., his trademark abilities have been his jumping and stomping powers, with which he defeats most of his enemies, and his ability to gain even more powers with a plethora of items, such as the Super Mushroom, the Fire Flower, and the Super Star. Games have usually portrayed Mario as a silent, straightforward character. According to Nintendo's philosophy, this allows Mario to fit in many different genres and roles. In the mainline games mostly, he is the hero who goes on an adventure to save Princess Peach from his arch-nemesis, Bowser, but he has been shown doing many other activities besides adventuring, such as racing and sporting with his younger but taller twin brother, Luigi; his friends such as Yoshi and Toad; and many other characters.","title":"","firstApp":"Donkey Kong, 1981","owl":"Starship Mario","owlImg":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YPOaaQpJLtg/maxresdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCIAKENAF8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGDAgSih_MA8=&rs=AOn4CLBUlqH7eKEl1WYo4HNBe27EeoFciw","um":"Mega Mushroom","umMedia":"https://i.redd.it/w2u0zunl14ta1.gif","lbo":[{"media":"Super Mario Bros.

He is a demigod son of his father Zeus and mother Callisto, as well as a brother of Deimos. Kratos is also the father of Calliope and Atreus, and was married to Lysandra and Laufey.\n\nOnce the brutal captain of the Spartan army, Kratos led his men through numerous conquests across Greece, eventually facing the Barbarians. Overwhelmed and on the verge of death, Kratos struck a deal with Ares by committing atrocity under his name. Even his own family grew horrified by his actions. Tragically, Ares tricked him into killing his wife and child, branding him the \"Ghost of Sparta\" with their ashes fused to his skin. Seeking redemption, Kratos served the other Gods of Olympus for ten years, enduring their labors that deepened his hatred for them. Ultimately, he defeated Ares and claimed the throne of the \"God of War\", but his fury against the Olympians led to a series of battles that determined Greece's fate.\n\nEventually leaving Greece as well as his bloody past behind, Kratos ends up in Ancient Egypt and makes his way into Midgard. Having come to view his troubled past with great shame, Kratos has taken the initiative to mature and grow past his self-destructive tendencies, choosing to live as a man under the Norse Pantheon. He even finds love again with a woman named Faye, eventually fathering a son with her named Atreus. When Faye dies of unknown circumstances, Kratos and Atreus set out on a journey to spread her ashes from the highest peak in all the Nine Realms as it was her final wish. However, the two come into conflict with various Nordic creatures along their way, and are constantly pursued by a mysterious Stranger — seemingly under orders from the King of the Norse Pantheon himself, Odin.\n\nAs Ragnarök unfolds, Kratos and Atreus were confronted by Odin and Thor. While embarking on a perilous journey across the Nine realms in a desperate attempt to stop Ragnarök, they join Freya's forces, but despite their efforts, it could not be prevented. Uniting allies from across the realms, they waged war against Asgard, with Kratos facing Thor once more and ultimately defeating Odin. As Asgard fell, the trio returned to Midgard, where Atreus (now \"Loki\") — set out to seek any remaining Giants, bidding a heartfelt farewell to his father. Meanwhile, Kratos and Freya, alongside Mímir, began the monumental task of rebuilding and restoring the Nine realms.

He is the deuteragonist of God of War (2018) and one of the two protagonists of God of War Ragnarök along with Kratos.\n\nIntroduced as the son of Kratos and Faye, Atreus joins his father on a journey to spread his deceased mother's ashes on top of the highest peak in all the Nine Realms. On their journey, Kratos teaches Atreus how to survive and fight as a warrior while Atreus teaches Kratos to open up to those that can help them.\n\nAs Atreus and Kratos reach Jötunheim to spread Faye's ashes on the Giant Finger's mountain, they learn that she was a Jötunn. As Atreus wonders about his heritage, he also learns that his mother gave him the birth name Loki.\n\nDuring Fimbulwinter, Atreus seeks answers about his Jötunn heritage, something Kratos cannot answer. This makes Atreus secretly partner up with Sindri to reexamine the Jötnar shrines, where they learn that a God of War and Champion will be of great importance during Ragnarök. As Kratos finds out about Atreus' secret activities, he reluctantly agrees to help him, hoping to prevent Ragnarök.\n\nAfter Atreus reconciles with his father, he manages to infiltrate Asgard and steal Odin's most prized possession, a mask with infinite knowledge. At Sindri’s house, it is revealed that Týr have been Odin in disguise and kills Brok. As the group manages to drive Odin away and retrieve the mask, they decide to start Ragnarök in order to bring Odin to justice for his crimes against the Nine Realms.\n\nAtreus, Kratos, Freya, and Mimir have a final battle with Odin, resulting in Atreus killing Odin by extracting his soul, who is then denied an afterlife by a vengeful Sindri who destroys his soul in revenge for Brok's demise. As Fimbulwinter ends, Atreus makes his way through the survivors to tell Angrboda and his father that he is going explore the lands outside of the Nine Realms, hoping to find the rest of the Giants. With Kratos' acceptance of his son's birthright, Loki would thus leave for his next adventure.","title":"","firstApp":"God of War, 2018","owl":"Thamur","owlImg":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tZgUnzXPc5Q/maxresdefault.jpg","um":"Light Arrow","umMedia":"https://cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2018/04/God-of-War-Shock-Arrows-How-to-Get-Use.webp","lbo":[{"media":"Ragnarok","levels":[{"title":"Tears of Fenrir","desc":"Atreus and Kratos return home to find their wolf companion Fenrir dying.
